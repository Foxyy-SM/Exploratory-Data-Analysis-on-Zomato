The problem it solves

The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions.
 It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables. 

Here we have taken ZOMATO data sets as an example through which we have predicted many results by looking at previous data sets.

Similarly we can download data sets from kaggle.com or many such websites to prediict some future results. We can build our own data by doing surveys online or doing it in our own college.

Many companies, startups  use EDA to predict if thier product will be helpful to people living in any particular area. In medical fields also **EDA** helps Doctors to know any trend of  diseases getting infecting people in different areas of world or in which type of people it is infecting more.

Graphs , Pivot tables , Heatmaps , Box Plots etc. makes easy for any human to analyse the data in a better way.
